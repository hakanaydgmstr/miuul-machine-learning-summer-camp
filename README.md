I attended a machine learning summer camp provided by Miuul. In summer camp, we covered 3 subjects:
 - Python for Data Science
 - Feature Engineering
 - Machine Learning

During the summer camp, I took notes and examples. You can find these notes in the subject's files (notes are in Turkish). Also, we did number of projects during the summer camp. You can find these projects in 'projects' file. Additionally, we create some functions to make some processes easier and use in the notebooks. All functions we created are in the 'funcs' file.
